# SQL Database Management Project

## Overview
This project showcases a series of SQL scripts designed to create, populate, and query a relational database. It demonstrates key skills in database schema design, data insertion, and complex SQL queries.

## Features
- `createdb.sql`: Defines the schema for `item`, `customer`, `rating`, and `invoice` tables.
- `inserts.sql`: Populates the database with sample data for each table.
- `query1.sql` to `query4.sql`: Executes various SQL queries to retrieve data, demonstrating skills in data filtering, aggregation, and complex SQL functions.

## Queries Explained
- Query 1: Retrieves names of all items manufactured by 'Samsung', sorted by descending price.
- Query 2: Lists distinct item names that have received a rating of 4 or higher.
- Query 3: Provides average star ratings and most recent rating dates for each item.
- Query 4: Displays customers and items with their highest star rating, where the item has varied ratings.

## How to Use
- First, execute `createdb.sql` in your SQL environment to set up the database schema.
- Run `inserts.sql` to populate the database with initial data.
- Execute each `query#.sql` file to see different types of data retrieval from the database.

## Learning Outcomes
- Database schema creation and management.
- Efficient data insertion techniques.
- Advanced query writing, including subqueries, aggregations, and sorting.
